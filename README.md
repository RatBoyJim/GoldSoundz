## Gold Soundz

### Intro
Gold Soundz is a solo project developed using object oriented programming with Python in a Test Driven Development. It was built as part of a project for the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

### Brief
Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers. To be completed in 1 week including presentation showcasing the final product.

### MVP

* The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price
* The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details
* The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately
* This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. Or a bookstore might sell books by author, or by publisher, and not by manufacturer
* You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate to your project
* Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view
* As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
